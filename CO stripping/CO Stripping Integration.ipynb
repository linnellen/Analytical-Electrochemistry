    "This script calculates electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) for a catalyst using the CO stripping method.\n",
    "\n",
    "CO stripping is used to measure catalyst accessibility (ECSA). CO has a high affinity for Pt and will displace other adsorbed species on catalyst particles. CO stripping is performed using a cyclic voltammogram (CV) with multiple cycles between 0 V and 1 V vs RHE after a CO monolayer forms on the catalyst surface. CO is oxidized off of the catalyst surface between 0.5 and 0.9 V during the first anodic sweep (and in small amounts during the following anodic sweeps):<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$CO^*+H_2O\\rightleftharpoons CO_2+2H^++2e^-$<br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "The characteristic surface charge expended to oxidize CO is 420 ÂµC/cm<sup>2</sup> which is used to convert integrated charge to ECSA. This is calculated by integrating the first oxidation peak with respect to time: \n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$Q=\\int Idt$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "It is important to bound the left side of the peak at the capacitive baseline current observed in subsequent CV cycles. The right side of the peak should be bound on the right side of the oxidation peak prior to the broad peak corresponding to Pt oxide formation. The function integrates between the first and second CV cycles. \n",
