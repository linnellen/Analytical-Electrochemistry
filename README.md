Analytical-Electrochemistry is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts which analyze data from laboratory techniques used to characterize catalyst layer degradation and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) performace. The Jupyter Notebooks provide an explanation of the technique used and the steps required to use the code. 

Steps to use Notebooks and scripts:
- Download Anaconda
- Open Jupyter Notebooks to use a Jupyter Notebook 
- Open Spyder to use a Python script
- Download entire folder containing script of interest as well as supporting files and images
- Navigate to folder containing script of interest in Jupyter Notebooks or in the Files tab of Spyder
- Open and run script
- For the Mass Activity tutorial, both of the .py files will need to be open
