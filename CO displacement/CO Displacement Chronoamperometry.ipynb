    "# CO Displacement Chronoamperometry\n",

    "This script calculates displaced charge for a CO displacement chronoamperometry (CA) experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "CO has a high affinity for Pt and will displace other adsorbed species on catalyst particles. During a displacement experiment, the cathode is held at a potential which results in either a positive or negative catalyst surface charge. This causes the adsorption of different charged species. The catalyst becomes negatively charged when held at low potentials which causes the adsorption of cations. Cations are displaced with the introduction of CO which corresponds to an oxidative current as the metal-ion bond is broken. The catalyst becomes positively charged when held at high potentials and adsorbs anions which produce a reductive current when displaced by CO. The total charge of the species displaced by CO can be found by integrating the oxidation/reduction peak associated with displacement with respect to time. This technique is primarily used to measure ionomer coverage on catalysts. Ionomer contains negatively charged sulfonate groups, so coverage is best measured at a potential where the catalyst has a positive surface charge but CO oxidation does not occurr. CO is oxidized at potentials greater than 0.4 V on Pt ionomer coverage measurements are best made at 0.4 V:<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$CO+\\frac{1}{2}O_2\\rightleftharpoons CO_2$<br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "After CO is introduced to displace surface species, it is stripped off the catalyst using cyclic voltammogram. The CO stripping charge (Q<sub>CO</sub>) and the displacement charge from the corresponding CO displacement experiment (q<sub>dis</sub>) are used to calculate sulfonate coverage according to the following equation:<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\theta_{Sulfonate}=\\frac{2*q_{dis}}{Q_{CO}}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "CO oxidation is a 2-electron process while CO displacement is a 1-electron process so a stoichiometric coefficient of 2 is used in the calculation.\n",
